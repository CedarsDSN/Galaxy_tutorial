**Accessing results**
======================

For accessing the results from the Primary analysis workflow, one can look the inputs (all the files you provided), all the outputs (all the outputs that were generated by tools in the workflow), output collections (folder of output files from a tool), and all the steps of the workflow. 

One can use the expand button for each of them and look at the file under each of them. For each file, one can either view the file, edit the filename or delete the file.
