**Importing data**
==================

For the tertiary analysis, we can use the counts from the Primary analysis workflow (specifically from the FeatureCounts tool). Most of the RNA-seq experiments have a single factor that they want to compare, for example, treated vs. untreated. If you have run the Primary analysis workflow and would like to import the counts file from the Primary analysis workflow and use it to conduct differential expression analysis and pathway analysis, use the steps below -

If you haven't run the Primary analysis and would rather download the example counts file to run the Tertiary analysis workflow, please follow the steps below - 

If you haven't run the Primary analysis and would like to run the Tertiary analysis workflow on your own data, please follow the steps below -
