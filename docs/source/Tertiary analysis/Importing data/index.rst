**Importing data**
==================

For the tertiary analysis, we can use the counts from the Primary analysis workflow (specifically from the FeatureCounts tool). Most of the RNA-seq experiments have a single factor that they want to compare, for example, treated vs. untreated. 

Before carrying out the Tertiary analysis workflow, remember to make a new history and name it "RNA-seq tertiary analysis"
