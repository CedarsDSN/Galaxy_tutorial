Tertiary Analysis
=================

This is the start of the tertiary analysis that can be carried out on your RNA-Seq samples to further explore your data. At this step, quantification has been carried out for all samples at the gene level and differential expression analysis can be carried out. It is important to know what you would like to compare with regard to your samples. One might think that comparing the count values in the files directly will shed light on the extent of differential gene expression. However, it is a little more complicated than that. The number of sequenced reads which map to a gene depends on two factors -
